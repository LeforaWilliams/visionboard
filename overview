Overview,

> VUE script file cannot talk to the database directly becuase it's not backend. Thus, we use axios to take the request from vue to our server. The server then goes to the database and returns the data to axios which takes it back to VUE script file with res.json (captured in the then from the axios request).

v-model connects our html to the data object in our script.js file

IN vue we need an api that sends the file data to the server - FORM DATA

In view, whatever is within the data object is accessible to the html

REACT PREPARATION
class (ES6)
> new way of creating constructors, can declare methods in the constructor class without having to separately declaring methods on the prototype


Inheritance
    > syntax --> class Pikachu extends Pokemon {}
    >super keyword runs the constructor of the parent. However, the child needs a constructor declaration becuase we can on ly call super inside of a constructor
    >the constructor of the parent is the only thing that is not automatically inherited. You have to run the constructur and run super in side of it
    >if you do not want to pass a method to the child you can use the keyword STATIC to prevent inheritance

Get and Set Keywords
    >if you use get and set keywords before a function you don't have to run them like a normal function but you can call them without the paranthese, you call them like a property of an object

Import and exports
    > use export deafault for only one object at the time
